I'm not really sure yet.

Requires [Futhark](http://futhark-lang.org), PyGame, and Numpy.

Run `make run` to run it in a window.


## Controls

  - Click to randomise the ether around the cursor.
  - Right-click to invert the ether around the cursor.
  - Use the scroll wheel to change the brush size.
