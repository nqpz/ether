I'm not really sure yet.

Requires [Futhark](http://futhark-lang.org) and SDL2 and SDL2-ttf
libraries with associated header files.


## Building and running

First run `futhark pkg sync` once.

Then run `make run` to build and run in a window.


## Controls

  - Click to randomise the ether around the cursor.
  - Right-click to invert the ether around the cursor.
  - Use the scroll wheel to change the brush size.
